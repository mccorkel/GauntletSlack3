# ChatGenius Implementation

This document outlines the technical implementation details for the ChatGenius application.

## Development Approach

*   **Agile Methodology:** We will follow an agile development approach with short sprints and iterative development cycles. This allows for flexibility and adaptation based on feedback and changing requirements.
*   **Blazor WebAssembly:** The frontend will be developed using Blazor WebAssembly, providing a rich and interactive user experience within the browser.
*   **ASP.NET Core Web API:** The backend will be built using ASP.NET Core Web API, providing RESTful endpoints for data access and real-time communication.
*   **Azure Cloud Platform:** Leverage Azure services for hosting, database, authentication, and messaging:
    *   Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) for hosting the Blazor WebAssembly frontend.
    *   Azure SQL Database for persistent data storage.
    *   Azure Pub/Sub for real-time messaging and presence updates.
    *   Azure Entra ID for user authentication and authorization.

## Coding Standards

*   **Clean Code:** Adhere to clean code principles, including meaningful naming conventions, consistent formatting, and well-commented code.
*   **SOLID Principles:** Follow SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) to promote modularity, maintainability, and testability.
*   **Design Patterns:** Utilize appropriate design patterns to address recurring problems and ensure code reusability.
*   **Atomic Design:** Follow atomic design principles for UI component development, creating a modular and scalable component library.

## Timeline Estimates

*   **Phase 1 (Authentication, Basic Messaging, Channel Organization):** 4 weeks
*   **Phase 2 (File Sharing, User Presence, Thread Support):** 6 weeks
*   **Phase 3 (Emoji Reactions, Performance Optimization, Refinement):** 4 weeks

**Note:** These are initial estimates and may be adjusted based on progress and unforeseen challenges.

## Technical Guidelines

*   **Version Control:** Utilize Git for version control and GitHub as the repository host.
*   **Branching Strategy:** Follow a Git branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow) to manage feature development, releases, and hotfixes.
*   **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate build, testing, and deployment processes.
*   **Testing:** Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
*   **Security:** Prioritize security considerations throughout the development process, including input validation, secure coding practices, and regular vulnerability assessments.

## Framework Specifics

*   **Blazor WebAssembly:**
    *   Utilize Blazor components for building reusable UI elements.
    *   Leverage Blazor's data binding capabilities for efficient UI updates.
    *   Implement state management using a suitable approach (e.g., Fluxor, Redux).
*   **ASP.NET Core Web API:**
    *   Use controllers to define API endpoints.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization using Azure Entra ID.
    *   Utilize middleware for request handling and logging.

## Development Preferences

*   **Atomic Design:**
    *   Break down UI components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
    *   Maintain a consistent design system for UI components.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality and knowledge sharing.

## Database Design

*   **Azure SQL Database:**
    *   Tables:
        *   `Users`: Store user information (username, email, password hash, etc.).
        *   `Channels`: Store channel details (name, description, type, etc.).
        *   `ChannelMembers`: Store channel membership information.
        *   `Messages`: Store message data (sender, content, timestamp, channel/DM ID, etc.).
        *   `Files`: Store file metadata (name, type, size, uploader, etc.).
        *   `Threads`: Store thread relationships and metadata.
        *   `Reactions`: Store emoji reactions to messages.
    *   Relationships: Define appropriate relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
    *   Normalization: Apply database normalization principles to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

## Azure Pub/Sub

*   Utilize Azure Pub/Sub for real-time features:
    *   Message delivery: Publish new messages to relevant channels/DMs.
    *   Presence updates: Publish user presence status changes.
    *   Notifications: Publish notifications for mentions, thread replies, etc.

## Azure Entra ID

*   Integrate Azure Entra ID for authentication and authorization:
    *   Secure user login and registration.
    *   Manage user roles and permissions.
    *   Control access to channels and resources.
